## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fluid typography

### What I learned

- [MDN Web Docs' article on client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
- [Styling lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_lists) - Needed to replace the standard bullets with the SVGs
- [Placeholder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/placeholder) - the placeholder text in an input field
- [How to Style CSS Focus Outline](https://joyofcode.xyz/css-focus-outline) - A better way to style focus outlines using box shadows
- [When do the :hover, :focus, and :active pseudo-classes apply?](https://bitsofco.de/when-do-the-hover-focus-and-active-pseudo-classes-apply/)
- [Advanced CSS-only Input Fields â€” Interactive, Animated, Validated](https://matemarschalko.medium.com/advanced-css-only-input-fields-interactive-animated-validated-d7ecff3cde8c) - love this approach and clear explanations, even though I am using a bit of Javascript. I created [a CodePen](https://codepen.io/silk0346/pen/eYqOqBQ) to follow along with the post.

### Continued development

Hmm ðŸ¤”

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Went here a lot to reference the different CSS properties and the shorthands, and all the great explanations about best practices.
